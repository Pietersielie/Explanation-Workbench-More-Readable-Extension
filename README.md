Explanation-Workbench-More-Readable-Extension
=====================

An extension of Matthew Horridge's Explanation Workbench for the Protégé Desktop Ontology Editor to have more readable explanations. In particular, it aims to provide ontology creators to define an explanation or readable format for/of an axiom. When the axiom is then displayed upon an explanatory request, it displays the creator-defined explanation if it exists.
